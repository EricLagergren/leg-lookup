<h1>Legislator Lookup</h1>
<p>Legislator lookup is a little pet project aimed at using multiple APIs to deliver on-demand information about our legislators.</p>

<p>Currently the project is a simple JS script (`api.js`) that uses openstates.org's data, but the current direction is moving towards a back-end solution in place of the current client-side.</p>

<p>The code is currently in testing -- it hasn't been refactored at all. This is the first draft.</p>
